                    I am a 22 year old web developer with one year of experience. Technology I have the most experience 
                    with is <strong>Drupal</strong>, but also like to work in <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>VueJS</strong>. 
                    I have experience working as part of a team and individually. When I struggle to solve a task,
                    I like to research in detail until I come to an appropriate solution and until I am sure that found solution is the best for a particular problem.
                    I am very passionate about my job and eager to learn new skills.

                        This project was done from zero. Client had a prepared website design for the development team. My job was to 
                        create Drupal custom theme, to create a custom modules and implement 3rd party APIs for a widget that client wanted 
                        to be implemented on their website.

                        The project was very complex and big which was very challenging. Our biggest milestone was to investigate how
                        Drupal migrations are working and we had to write custom scripts for migrating 50K+ content pages from client's 
                        old site to the new Drupal site. Another challenge on this project was to implement webform for 13 different languages
                        and 13 different email handlers. Form had a very large complexity for registering customer's registered products.

                        The project was an internal one, where we had a legacy code that had to be refactored. The project was more 
                        Front-End based so my main goal was to enable to content editor to manage data properly in Drupal backoffice.
